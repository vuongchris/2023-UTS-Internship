Continuous integration is a process of automating the building and testing of code every time a developer commits changes to version control on a central repository. Continuous delivery is the automated process to build, test, configure and deploy from a build to a production environment. These two processes helps find bugs quicker, prevent merge conflicts, and reduce the time for new releases.

Some of the tools used for continuous integration and delivery are Microsoft Azure and AWS CodePipeline. These tools are used to help developers find defects to fix problems faster and have a deployment ready build that can be released at any time.
